# TransBorderFreight_Data_Analysis_Project

This project analyses freight movement data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) to uncover insights on transportation efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability. It is managed by the Data Analytics team at getINNOtized.

## Objectives
- Identify inefficiencies in freight transport (e.g. congestion, delays)
- Evaluate environmental impacts across transport modes
- Recommend data-driven solutions for system improvement
